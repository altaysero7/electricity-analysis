# electricity-analysis

C-language program that reads a CSV file containing electrical data, creates a linked list of the data rows and analyzes the data. The analysis consists of two parts:

1. Consumption

the total number of measurements per year
total consumption of electricity in a year
average consumption per hour
at which hour of the year there was the biggest consumption
at which hour of the year there wast he least consumption.

The program prints the results on the screen and writes them to a text file.

2. Production

The production of different types of energy is summarized per type and per week.
